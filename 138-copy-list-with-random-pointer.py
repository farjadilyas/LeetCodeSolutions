  Problem Statement:
  - A normal singly linked list with the addition of random pointers on every node that may link to any other Node or
    none at all is given
  - Write a program that creates a deep copy of the given linked list, such that no node involved in the output linked
    list involves a node that was present in the input linked list

  APPROACH: RESPECT THE DEPENDENCY
  - IDEA: There is a dependency between the nodes that are pointing to and the one that is pointed by the random pointer
    - In addition, there is the next pointer dependency as well
    - In short, if we are at a Node, we don't know if the next Node or the random Node have been copied
    - When combined with the fact that the random node is part of the next chain..
    - The order in which new Nodes should be created isn't clear

  - So... there are two clear options:
    - Respect the dependencies one by one and copy all nodes using the next chain
        - Since random nodes can point only to a node that is part of the next chain or is None
        - We can now look up the copied Nodes in the next chain and use them to inform the random pointer
    - Traverse the dependency in the order in which they are encountered
      - Explicitly keep track of the mapping from original node to potentially copied node
      - Do a graph-style traversal, if any node encountered in the traversal has not been copied, copy it, continue to
        traverse

  - SELECT APPROACH
    - Both options have the same O(N) Time Complexity
    - Both have the same space complexity (O(N) if answer is counted)
    - Can go with either, I went with the first one

  - OPTIMIZATION: Remove need for a HashMap (a bit of a hack)
    - The need for a hashmap in both options can be removed by introducing a pointer in the original node to reference
      a potentially copied node
    - Hence, having the original - copy mapping no longer requires a hashmap

  Time Complexity: O(N)
  Space Complexity: O(N) - for deep copied linked list
