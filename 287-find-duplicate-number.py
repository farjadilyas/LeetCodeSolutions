  287. Find the Duplicate Number
  [ Medium ] | [ 59.0% ] -- Solved 26/07/2022 -- [ Array, Two Pointers ]

  Problem Statement:
  - An array of n+1 integers, each of which is in the range [1, n]
  - There is only one repeated number, find it
  - Using only constant space
"""


"""
  APPROACH #1: BINARY SEARCH
  - Sort the array, so the duplicates occur together
  - Since the integers are in range [1,n] and there are n integers, we can make the following assumption:
    - If the left part of the array, that has been read, does not contain a duplicate, then arr[n] = n+1
    - Hence, if arr[n] is smaller than expected, the duplicate is to the left
    - If arr[n] is larger than expected, the duplicate is to the right
  
  - Hence, it is sort + binary search to narrow down on the duplicated element

            start = middle+1

"""
  APPROACH #2: FLOYD'S CYCLE FINDING ALGORITHM - FAST AND SLOW
  - Interpret the input array as a linked list, where the indices are the nodes, and the values are the pointers
  - This means that duplicate values -> multiple pointers to the same node -> a cycle
  
  - Use Floyd's cycle finding algorithm, fast and slow pointer, remember where the intersect
  - Reset the slow pointer, run the slow and fast pointers at the same speed now
  - The node of intersection is now the node where the cycle starts
