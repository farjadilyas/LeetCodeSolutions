  Approach:
  Given two lists, with the numbers written in reverse order (leftmost is unit).
  In one pass, we add two lists, node by node. The l2 list is used as the answer list, if it falls
  short in size, it is linked to the remaining l1 list. Efficient on time and space
  - Adding two lists sounds easy, the slight twist is that the lists may not be the same size, one may be shorter than
    the other

  Intuition:
  - Simplify this problem by deciding that l2 is going to be the longer list. If it turns out to be the shorter one,
    we can link l2's last node to the first remaining l1 node. The remaining nodes just need the carry, if any, to be
    added to them

  Time Complexity: O(N)
  Space Complexity: O(1) -- using input as the output list
