"""
  No-Sort solution
  - Sorting gives us the following two advantages:
    - Enables the two-pointer 2sum solution, without sorting we have to use the hashset 2sum solution
    - Allows us to avoid dups easily since in both the outer and inner loops we can increment over dups

  - So if we have to remove sorting:
    - We have to use the hashset 2sum solution
    - We need to figure out a way to deal with dups

  - DEALING WITH DUPs in a no-sort solution
    - Maintain a hashset for the values encountered in the outer loop to skip dups for that
    - In the inner loop, sort each result triplet and store it in a hashset
    
  - Practically, no-sort is slower, less obvious, and less flexible if you need to come up with a solution for an
    alternative version of 3sum, but its a good exercise
