  42. Trapping Rain Water
  [ Hard ] | [ 58.9% ] -- Solved 25/12/2022
  Faster than: 90.5% | Less memory: 46.7%

  Problem:
  - Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much
    water it can trap after raining.

  APPROACH:
  - Very intuitive, similar to #11 - container with most water
  - Amount of water that can be held is the minimum of the heights of the two local maximas on either side of a point
  - Place two pointers on either end
  - Forward pass calculates how much water can be held assuming water doesn't drain from the other side
  - Backward pass does the same in the reverse direction
  - Taking the minimum of the results of the two passed gives how much water can be held if water can drain on either
    side, i.e, the final answer
  - The three passed can be combined into one with some conditions

  Time Complexity: O(N)
  Space Complexity: O(N) - array for storing forward pass values

  OPTIMAL SOLUTION - O(N) time - O(1) space
  - Two pointer solution
  - Two pointers point to the edge of the left and right subset that have had their solutions calculated
  - Every move of a pointer finds the solution for the new position the pointer points to
  
  - Start with two pointers on 0 and N-1
  - Let leftMax hold the max value pointed to by leftPtr so far, same for rightMax
  - Move the pointer with the smaller value forward
  - EXPLANATION:
    - lets say left subarray is [0,1,2] and right subarray is [3,1]
    - left ptr at two should move forward because the formula for the answer at leftPtr+1 is:
      - min(leftMax, rightMax) - height[i]
      - if left ptr moves forward..
        - we know leftMax for i for sure (no elements left)
        - leftPtr would only move to the right if the right side had a bigger element
        - hence: rightMax > leftMax -> min(leftMax, rightMax) = leftMax
        - hence we know all we need to calculate the answer for the new leftPtr position
  - Once you have moved one of the pointers, make sure to update the respective max for the Ptr
  
  KEY INSIGHT:
  - First its important to realise the formula for the answer at a point
  - ans[i] = min(leftMax, rightMax) - height[i]
  - We needed the space since we could keep one running total w.r.t the iteration, but the total in the other
    direction needed to be memoized
  - Using two pointers, we can reach the elements that are first limited by ONE OF the running totals so far
  - Realise that the limiting total will definitely be less than the potential total in the opp direction
    if we move the smaller pointer
  - Hence, we resolve the left and right total dependency in linear time without needing the opposing total memoized
